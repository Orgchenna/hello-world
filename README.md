# hello-world
Just another repository for now
But I don't intend for things to stay that way
I am a Sales/Marketing Administrator from LA who studied Finance in college
My evolution has drawn me to the tech industry, which I have been watching closely since 2011
I plan on spending a lot of time immersed in learning, building, and modifying we & computer programs moving forward
